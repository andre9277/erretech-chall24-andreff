# Érre Technology - Challenge ‘24

Build a Client Manager application using React.js, integrated with the provided backend API for authentication only. The application should allow employees to manage client contacts, information, client needs, events, and important start/end dates.

## Requirements:
### Authentication Integration:
Download the provided Postman collection, and use the provided authentication endpoints for the users management, implementing functionality for users to Login and Register. Only “login” and “create-user” are mandatory, the rest is optional.

### Data:
Data must only be stored in the browser, and nothing will be saved in the backend but the authentication. An “Export to JSON” button must be included in the UI, providing the functionality to export any client full data as a JSON.

### Component Structure:
Create appropriate components to organize the application's structure logically. Consider components for displaying client lists, adding/editing client information, and
displaying client details.

### State Management:
Utilize React state to manage client data, form inputs, and any UI state. Ensure that changes in state trigger appropriate updates to the UI.

### CRUD Operations:
Implement functionality to add new clients, retrieve existing clients, edit client information, and delete clients.

### Client Information:
Include fields for storing client information such as name, email, phone number, address, and any other relevant details.
Implement validation to ensure required fields are filled out properly. 

### Client Needs and Dates:
Allow users to add notes or details about client needs, requirements, or preferences. Implement functionality to store and display important dates related to clients (e.g.,
upcoming meetings, deadlines).

### Search and Filter:
Provide functionality to search for clients by name or filter them based on specific criteria (e.g., company, status).

### Styling:
Apply styling to make the application visually appealing and easy to use. Use any styling you want.

### Submission Guidelines:
Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand. Once completed, share the link to your repository with us for evaluation.
